            <p>FROM A YOUNG AGE, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PASSION FOR MUSIC.  
                I BEGAN PLAYING THE TRUMPET AROUND AGE 7 AND I QUICKLY WANTED TO LEARN ANOTHER INSTRUMENT. I PICKED UP THE BASS GUITAR AND PLAYED A LOT OF DRUMS AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE
                BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY GUITAR. I SAVED UP AND BOUGHT MY ELECTRIC GUITAR AND I HAVE BEEN WRITING MUSIC AND PLAYING IN BANDS EVER SINCE.

        <div class="hockey">
            <p>GROWING UP I WAS NEVER REALLY INTERESTED IN SPORTS. MY PARENTS PUT ME IN A FEW DIFFERENT SPORTS BUT I NEVER WANTED TO GO BACK. WHEN I WAS 8, MY FRIEND INTRODUCED ME TO HOCKEY AND I BECAME OBSSESSED WITH IT. 
                I BEGAN PLAYING HOCKEY AND PLAYED COMPETITIVELY UNTIL AGE 18. NOW I MOSTLY JUST PLAY FOR FUN AND WOULD LIKE TO POSSIBLY JOIN A NON-COMPETITIVE ADULT LEAUGUE SOME TIME SOON.
                 I ALSO WATCH HOCKEY AS MUCH AS I CAN, I AM A NEW YORK ISLANDERS FAN AND I TRY TO GO TO A FEW GAMES TO SEE THEM PLAY EVERY YEAR.</p>

        <div class="sewing">
            <p>SEWING IS A RELATIVELY NEW HOBBY OF MINE. WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I STARTED TO BECOME VERY INTERESTED IN STYLE AND FASHION.  
                MY INTEREST IN STYLE AND FASHION HAS ONLY GROWN AS I HAVE GOTTEN OLDER SO LAST YEAR I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO START MAKING MY OWN CLOTHES TO WEAR.
                I LOVE THE WHOLE PROCESS OF MAKING MY OWN CLOTHES. FROM THINKING ABOUT A PIECE OF CLOTHING I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE, TO SKETCHING IT OUT, BUYING THE FABRIC, CUTTING AND SEWING THE FABRIC AND THEN SEEING MY IDEA COME TO LIFE. I REALLY ENJOY IT AND I HOPE TO KEEP GETTING BETTER AND BETTER.
